This is a simple web application to mimic a website that has a store component. This was done in order to get more used to working with states (via hooks) as well as incorporating "react-router-dom" for the first time. 

This application is broken into three main components: the homepage (Home.js), the store (Shop.js), and the about page (About.js). There are many more components that go into making up these main three. Most of the components actually go into fuclly implementing the shop page.


This application was created to also pay an homage to Jomatech and his startup.
